Library for Space efficient (graph) algorithms
===
Because of the rapid growth of the data sizes in nowadays applications, algorithms
that are designed to efficiently utilize space are becoming more and more
important. Another reason for the need for such algorithms is the limitation in
the memory sizes of tiniest devices.

Therefore, this library provides algorithms that treat space as a scarce resource.
